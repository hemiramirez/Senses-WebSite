        <p>We are a Human Management consulting firm aware that the challenges faced by our daily life in terms of their most valuable resource, people, are very similar to those of large companies. However, their resources, maturity and vision of the environment do not allow them to choose to undertake the same solutions.
        Through a diagnosis of the current processes of the organization, we measure, analyse, and intervene the organizational gaps that allow us to determine how aligned the organizational structure, workload, functions, and competencies profile of the collaborators are with the vision of the organization
